# Side-channel_attacks_on_RSA
## Semester 6 BSP

## Project description
### Scientific Aspects:
"The student will learn about a variety of powerful attacks on the RSA cryptosystem, arising from side-channel leakage (timing, power consumption) or leakage obtained from decryption oracles (single bit of decryption leakage, or fault attacks.
The BSP will answer the following questions: What is RSA? What are side-channel and fault attacks? How effective are side-channel and fault attacks against RSA?"

### Practical Aspects:
"The technical work involves using a small microcontroller/microcomputer and performing RSA operations on it and then attempting to extract private information during the computation by performing one or multiple side-channel or fault injection attacks on the microcomputer. Private information includes variables used by the RSA scheme, generated private and public keys, or any other information that could assist in breaking the encryption.
The student will implement software demonstrating the attacks (simulating side-channel leakage, faults, etc.), and perform some attacks on a real hardware device (ChipWisperer)."
